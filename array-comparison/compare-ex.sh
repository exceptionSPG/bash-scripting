#In this exercise, you will need to compare three list of arrays and write the common elements of all the three arrays:
#a=(3 5 8 10 6),b=(6 5 4 12),c=(14 7 5 7) result is the common element 5.

a=(3 5 8 10 6)
b=(6 5 4 12)
c=(14 7 5 7)

for i in ${a[@]}; do
	for j in ${b[@]}; do
		for k in ${c[@]}; do
			if [[ $i == $j && $j == $k ]] ; then
				echo $i

			fi
